| static goal Reaching    | isaac_ik | custom_ik |
| -------- | -------  | ------- |
| Pwm motor  |  works, it moves quicker than Pwm + CustomIk, but may oscillates more(harder to converge)   |works, but slow to converge, worse when target is far away, need about 15s episode length |
| ideal pd | Work well, but ik end effector needs to be hand instead of chop tip, Parrallelizable    |Work well, not parallelizable|
